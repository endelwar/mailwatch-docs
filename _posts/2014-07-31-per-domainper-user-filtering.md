## Per Domain/Per User Filtering

MailWatch for MailScanner 1.0 has implemented new filtering capabilities to be able to support per-domain filtering or per-user filtering more effectively than previously.

To utilise this new functionality - all you need to do is create MailWatch users named by either their domain or their e-mail address and set their user type accordingly.

For example:

* If you create a user named `smf@example.com` as user type `User` and I log-in as that user, I will only be able to see e-mail address to/from me and to be able to add Blacklist/Whitelist entries for my address (if enabled).
* If I create a user named `example.com` as type `Domain Administrator` and I log-in as that user, I will only be able to see messages to/from my domain or create blacklist/whitelist entries for the entire domain or for a specific user.
* The `Administrator` type can do anything for any user or domain.
* If you need to have `aliases` for your users - e.g. `smf@example.com` also has an e-mail alias `steve.freegard@example.org`, then no problem - use the `Filters` screen to add `steve.freegard@example.org` and the `smf@example.com` user will be able to see both.

Easy!
